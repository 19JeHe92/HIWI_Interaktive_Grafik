# HIWI_Interaktive_Grafik

## Getting started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project and show you how to running it on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

This project creates an interactive graphic from a data set. For security reasons most browsers will not allow loading data through external sources unless you're on a server. This forces you to set up a local server on your machine.

There are several ways to easily start a local server on your computer. Here two possible ways are described.

### 1. Use python
Make sure you've python and pip
Before you go any further, make sure you have Python and that it’s available from your command line. You can check this by simply running:

`python --version`

You should get some output like 3.6.2. If you do not have Python, please install the latest 3.x version from python.org

Additionally, you’ll need to make sure you have pip available. You can check this by running:

`pip --version`

If you installed Python from source, with an installer from python.org, you should already have pip.

### 2. Use XAMPP
